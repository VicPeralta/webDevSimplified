            The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The group, whose best-known line-up
            comprised
            John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, are regarded as the most influential band of
            all time.
            They were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art
            form.
            Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and
            traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian
            music to
            psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles
            revolutionised
            many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural
            movements.

            The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide.
            They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the
            Billboard
            Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million).
            The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards,
            an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards.
            They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted
            individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest
            artists in
            history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.
